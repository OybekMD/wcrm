The Comment Service facilitates active dialogue by managing comments, replies, and discussions across various channels. Through its seamless integration with other services, it ensures that every interaction is captured, analyzed, and leveraged to enhance customer satisfaction.

API Gateway:

Serving as the gateway to our CRM ecosystem, the API Gateway consolidates and simplifies access to our microservices. It provides a unified interface for clients to interact with our system while enforcing security, rate limiting, and other essential policies. Powered by GoLang's flexibility and performance, it ensures low-latency communication and seamless scalability, even under high loads.
